# Kamaishi_project

Developed website using CakePHP that allows individuals to complete stamp rallys (https://www.atlanta.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jettravel3.htm) with the help of Google's location Maps and Location APIs. 
The purpose of the app is to encourage visitors to visit certain land marks, the idea was spawned by a city that had struggled to attrack tourists around the region after the earthquake in 2011.
Ideally the provider should give a prize for those who collect all the stamps as an incentive for people to join.
