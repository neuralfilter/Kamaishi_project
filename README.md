Developed website using CakePHP that allows individuals to complete stamp rallys (https://www.atlanta.us.emb-japan.go.jp/jettravel3.htm#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Cstamp%20rally%E2%80%9D%20is%20a,fair%20to%20visit%20every%20vendor.&text=As%20they%20visit%20each%20vendor,or%20entry%20into%20a%20raffle.) with the help of Google's location Maps and Location APIs. 
The purpose of the app is to encourage visitors to visit certain land marks, the idea was spawned by a city that had struggled to attrack tourists around the region after the earthquake in 2011.
Ideally the provider should give a prize for those who collect all the stamps as an incentive for people to join.
