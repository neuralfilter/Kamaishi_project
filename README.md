Developed website using CakePHP that allows individuals to complete stamp rallys with the help of Google's location Maps and Location APIs. 
## Purpose
The purpose of the app is to encourage visitors to visit certain land marks, the idea was spawned by a city that had struggled to attrack tourists around the region after the earthquake in 2011.
## What is a stamp rally?
A stamp rally is a type of game that uses augmented reality by tracking whether individuals have visited certain locations.
Ideally the provider should give a prize for those who collect all the stamps as an incentive for people to interact with their attractions.
